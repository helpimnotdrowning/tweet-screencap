# Tweet-Screencap
A Python bot to post video frames to Twitter every half-hour. Originally created within about 4 hours, this has become my first real "project".

The real meat of this bot is in the [tweet_screencap.py](tweet_screencap.py) file.

# Setup
Currently planning to make a tutorial file on setting this bot up. Until then, [make an issue](https://github.com/helpimnotdrowning/tweet-screencap/issues/new) and I'll help you with setting things up to start posting.

If you DO decide to use this bot, please include a link to this README.md file in your bot account's Website section of your bio and tell me about it, I'd love to see how you're using my bot.

I won't show up to your house if you don't, so no pressure ;)
